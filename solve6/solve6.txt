Parity Regions

https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=0004Z9

- Another option is to do consecutive regions.
- Whatever the case, it would be nice if every cell was in some region.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y8ak8bud it's actually probably really difficult...
- If we were to brute force search for one, we should first just see if parity is possible.
- This requires no odd region size > 9 or even region > 8. Even regions must be even sized and vice versa.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9ft8pug seems unlikely that this is possible unless you have many many diagonal separations.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yaz6xzd3 without odd parity restriction... With the parity restriction seems impossible.
- Push comes to shove, we could just do +1/-1 but that feels awful...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9tr38z6 we can get one big odd region + valid even regions but this puzzle is probably dumb...
- Even continuous region just seems impossible.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yameyr3n inversion count 3.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ycwz8a2z inversion 2...
- Maybe with an identical ruleset it would be okay. Lower inversion cell number may be better.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yag7syy5 2 inversion cells but there are conflicting 2's in a region + 1 odd cell.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ybs9crhs 8 inversion

Logic:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9bbaw7k with negative constraint.
- There is literally no logic except for neighboring digits, what a colossal failure.

Thermo or palindrome

Distinguishing logic:
- It would be great if we had a lot of long lines.
- We could also do odd circle + palindrome vs thermo lol
- 1. No possibility of 1/9.
- 2. Bad quadruple https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yct5fbee!
- 3. Naked single for palindrome.
- Half combos into a forced palindrome: https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5kekplr
- It's a bit too obvious though once you fill in the possibilities.
- Convoluted as hell reasoning to eliminate a palindrome. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4or97p4
- A length 6 palindrome with the appropriate end in either box would be enough to force the palindrome.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3yanef2 is arguably a bit nicer.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y553gne2 one valid possibility but no flow at all.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2xd33wf so close :(
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y55z4w4x dead again
- If you play it safe like this, you get nothing
- Somewhat working! https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6r9bjo4

Potential images:
- Broken pencil to theme around the broken creation of the puzzle.
- Can't have any branching thermos.
