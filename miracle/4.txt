Puzzle revoles around 7/27 clues

Ideas:
- X-sum:
- 7 only has 2/5 which is a dud
- 27 is from 4-6, 18 in 3-5

- Sandwich:
- 7 can be 1/2 wide
- 27 can have 1/2 outie

- Killer:
- 7 in 2 has 3 possibilities
- 3/4 has 2 lower digits, otherwise 1 lower and 1 higher
- 27 in 4 requires a 9
- The other digits may contain 1 lower digit
- Coloring would be nice with the 7's but it's pretty difficult without negative constraint
- 7/7/27 is impossible funnily enough
- High low coloring would be nice

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yexd8yg8 there is an argument for just letting it gracefully solve to respect the amazing break in and acknowledge it
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ykxfyeuc this is a very hand holdy way to explore the same concept, fine with it if it immediately leads to something
