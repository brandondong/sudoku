Phistomefel odd neighbors

https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yy9x9u34 should work but is too similar to the last puzzle's config

https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxab6lzm this may work?
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6rqv5h8 yes!!
- Unfortunately a sole sandwich force is impossible because it leads to an invalid box 4 + 6 https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y25qoeqn
- Actually you can use a killer cage on the other corner in each corner box, disgusting!
- Wait nevermind, the 4 odd digits give away too much
- Using 3 sandwiches and one corner on the other hand...
- This just sounds too frustrating.

Lemmas:
- 3 cells summing to 3 must either be 1-1-1, 2-2-2, 3-3-3, or 1-2-3.
- 3 cells summing to 9 or 21 must use the 1-2-3 pattern.
- 2 cells summing to 3 must be 3-3 or 1-2.
- In a line/column/box, if there is a 1-2-3, the others must be 1-2-3.

- Box 7 shows we're in a 3-3-3 pattern, 7 is not needed. Then, only 9 in box 4 is needed to finish the first 3 columns.
- With that completed, we know we don't have a 3-3-3 pattern on the horizontal anymore.
- Instead of giving the 2 in box 7, we could give a 2 diagonal! Cannot be 1-1, 2-3 order is forced!
- Box 2 tells us those columns are vertical 3-3-3 patterns either which is enough to derive box 8.
- We could also eliminate 3-3-3 by noticing 2 in box 5.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y7kbes26 is derivable with the given numbers...
- Filling out the 1-4-7's gives the remainder of the color derivation

How would knowing the mod help?
- Maybe have one large min/max diagonal

How to derive modness?
