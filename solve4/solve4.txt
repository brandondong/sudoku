Tetris Sudoku

Ideas:
- Cover the board with tetris pieces except 1 cell.
- Each piece summing to 20 is awful for humans.
- Each piece having uniform parity is probably interesting but sounds extremely difficult to allocate parity if not impossible.
- There's 36 evens and 45 odds in the grid so definitely impossible.
- We could partially fill the grid but then we would need so many numbers which would ruin the aesthetic.
- Pieces and be colored and some pieces may be given showing a tetris game in progress.
- Maybe 4 consecutive digits which would interact nicely with sandwich sudoku.

Computing a consecutive solution:
- Manually construct Tetris pieces, as many as possible.
- The algorithm fills in one tetris piece at a time, 6 * 24 = 144 possibilities per 4 squares or ~3.4 per cell.

- Even just https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9u5cpdq has no solution because of the 1-5 restriction...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yaum4odh is possible giving the 1-9 in row 1.
- Giving the sandwich sum for row 2 isn't half bad https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yczfwo5e
- It would be nice to clear column 1 to fit the Tetris theme by giving the 9 and 45 sum.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y7vqenjw is still possible as long as you provide column 1 sum such that 9 is not in box 1.

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y7fd2gbo this works well as it forces 5 sum in column 1 but it can't be 1-5-9.

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y8kyuw7m solution
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y8422lf4 with these sandwich clues, I'm not a fan of the multiple ways to apply the 5 clue.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydckahgx 18 clue is quite efficient.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yccfmpld we've trapped ourselves in a corner...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y82absfe not super happy tbh but maybe we can remove some pieces?
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ycqz428z not bad! 5 logic is restored
