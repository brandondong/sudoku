Sandwich sudoku:

- Row 2 with a value of 8 cannot be 2-6 or 3-5. Same with row 3 but it doesn't really tell you where the 1-8-9 triples are.

Provide odd digits:
- You can't only provide odd digits or else all evens are interchangeable.
- Can't only provide black dots as that only covers 1-2 and 3-6. But combined with white dots with 9, you wouldn't have to provide many.
- They also tell you there is an even-odd sequence.
