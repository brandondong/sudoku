Diagonals:
- Lines are probably easiest?
- If we make them two groups of 4 each, we should be able to disambiguate everything with just one row.
- At the same time, intersecting lines sound hilarious.
- Maybe you could find some clever way to prove a diagonal must contain a duplicate.

- Maybe if you just shove enough diagonals, some interesting coloring behavior will emerge. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4ma99dl
- Best off using diagonals to avoid multiple forced naked singles. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4kdcfm2 -> https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxd9zoss
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5vsq9to omg this is the best we're going to get!
- The row we give shouldn't really matter I think as long as we disambiguate the deadly pattern https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yya9j683

How in the world can we possible solve this?
- We can first group them and count https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y36dhsot
- Just giving a 7 in r1c2 leads to https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyfq8rwb pretty nicely using the diagonal edges.

Lemmas:
- Rwo identical diagonal lines cannot intersect at opposite directions! It's pretty obvious though with concrete, short lines.
- 5 repeated diagonals cannot have a duplicate digit in the diagonal.
