Puzzle revoles around 7/27 clues

Ideas:
- X-sum:
- 7 only has 2/5 which is a dud
- 27 is from 4-6, 18 in 3-5

- Sandwich:
- 7 can be 1/2 wide
- 27 can have 1/2 outie

- Killer:
- 7 in 2 has 3 possibilities
- 3/4 has 2 lower digits, otherwise 1 lower and 1 higher
- 27 in 4 requires a 9
- The other digits may contain 1 lower digit
- Coloring would be nice with the 7's but it's pretty difficult without negative constraint
- 7/7/27 is impossible funnily enough
- High low coloring would be nice

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yeu63y5y Basic coloring
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzgpnbla Not very interesting...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjyqn6wh good luck with this so much for an easy puzzle
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhmq57no rip what are you doing...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yeljbmqb wow wow wow
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfjlu5v3 there is the diff 27 logic....

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yexd8yg8 there is an argument for just letting it gracefully solve to respect the amazing break in and acknowledge it
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ykxfyeuc this is a very hand holdy way to explore the same concept, fine with it if it immediately leads to something
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygxl7cgk combo combo combo...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yffz4bef not bad
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzwd8f6w freebies?
= https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg3czqju pretty efficient
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg6wlofa seems to magically work...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygrw6hwq first draft


Review:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfutjs6t nevermind, break in is actually trivial
- There's only a couple of phases:
1. Easy break in (3/4, duplicate logic, full disambiguation)
2. Quintuple not bad comboing into 6 in box 5
3. Box 5 look ahead, nastiest part
4. 4 force into box 6
5. Extreme amounts of sudoku to finish off, pretty mechanical and brainless
- In conclusion, hot garbo of a puzzle and although it might get a decent amount of solves, there's no good idea in there
- I don't want to waste the break in idea on such a garbo puzzle

Pink coloring would be very nice!

Attempt 2:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhq42s78 here is the true break in 
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yflsc3xd wow!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj6by8fx ok I think we definitely have something special on our hands...
- Not opposed to reusing the quintuple logic but it's quite random at this point, really should use the 1/6 2/5 disambiguation or coloring
- In terms of shifts, we only have 1 horizontal or 1 veritcal possibility, 4 possibilities in total
- 100% we are using an X so this puzzle can end soon and won't mess up the break-in

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yf2fdfo8 pretty inefficient...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfbganxh great stuff working in the quintuple naturally
- Diagonal sounds great right about now, 2 still work, not much to gain
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygw29r42 both flip diagonal is really powerful...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg8pnfdo not terrible, unfortunately kills the earlier 2 deduction, breaks with X
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz5nlt2q lo and behold, this is death for X
- Maybe it would be sensible at this point to compute X's that work because there might not be many...
- I think up to the quintuple step is pretty great...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yedgepbv rip break in bypassed again LUL
- Back to the drawing board https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfxyztfe
- Actually, this fails like the previous 1/2 breakage just more convoluted
- True, but it still captures the spirit of the break in which is the green in column 3 must be each in a 27 cage
- In fact, we don't need the column 2 setup at all although it is a good pointer
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yeubcafx seems like there is something here but I don't know what
- You can go very far with just coloring which is fine as long as we don't continue it and they eventually get surprised at everything disambiguating
- Certainly with this approach, the column 3 thing is not so arbitrary and the underlying idea is quite boring after all
 - The coloring is much more interesting and the disambiguation of digits is the magic bonus
 - https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzgxscku obvious next step
 - https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzxcbpec right idea but dead
 - https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjdmb9uk excellent!
 - Disambiguation of 1/6 2/5 is actually not required but it's very pretty if you decide to go that route
 - https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydmdxnun omg what???
 - In review, the box 9 quintuple is actually very well communicated
 - For the diagonals, we can only shift and then flip that shifted 3 columns leading to 4 possibilities, one of which is already dead
 - Right now, there's simply no way we can disambiguate the 8/9's, some 27 cage will be needed!

 - https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhngzmws honest effort dead
 - https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfb2pfqu again lol
 - I think single diagonal is sort of f'd tbh

Rules:
- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- Normal killer cage rules apply (the numbers in the cage must sum to the given total in the top left and numbers must not repeat in a cage).
- On the marked diagonal, digits cannot repeat.

This puzzle is dedicated to the most frustrating video game I know of. The title, numerical clues, and color are all thematic. Hopefully, the puzzle itself contains no such frustration!

Bypass using 9?
- Not really anything you can do about it because it's crucial to our finisher which is just easy sudoku to end on a good note
- It's not clear that it's really that actionable https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yffqn8ar
- It really isn't https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzkoqaqx and it's arguable that this is more beautiful than the other order
