Thermo/Renban/Odd Mix-up

Ideas:
- Both have set properties (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KokZykCkgUw length 6 thermo's where >= 3 are in one line are key)
- Renban with length >= 5 must contain a 5, length >= 6 must contain a 4/5/6 and so on
- Would be nice to use a 4/5/6 to fully eliminate a possibility in a thermo to force one or the either
- Once you've established a length 6 renban or a length 7 thermo, this should be possible...
- We probably want the break-in to use something with set theory somehow but I don't think it's enough by itself...
- Would be classic to have an odd cell full elimination again

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5s8ufy5 interesting pattern, you could put a 5 to instant disambiguate right now...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y57ve9ag using a 4 leads to nice logic on the red
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y44lj5y6 seems like we can't get shit...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6f4g856 if 5, you force this
- It means we can force 1/2 https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3emnqpb
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3kpt663 much more graceful!
