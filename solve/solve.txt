Consecutive Path Sudoku

Rules:
Normal sudoku rules apply.
For each 1 digit on the board, there exists a path starting at that 1, which then connects to a 2, which then connects to a 3... all the way to 9 using only orthogonally adjacent cells.

Provided is an example board which meets this constraint for its given 1's.

If we give all green parity digits in every box, then we can eliminate half of all the 1 positions!
- 8 is really clean compared to 4 and it doesn't tell you anything about 9!

- We can derive all the 1 positions from here!

For the 2's:

- We know there must be a 2 in r7c3 or r8c3 from box 1 and 4.
- No contradiction if we make r8c9 a 2 and when we do, all 2's are different from the solution except r4c5.
- If we force r4c5 to not be a 2, there's no contradiction either.
- By giving the fake 2 in r5c9, we can derive 6 2's. Only the last 2 is interesting.
- We'd have to place a lot of 3's to make it interesting.
- We could potentially trap a path into a corner and show that all other possibilities lead to path contradictions (e.g. box 1 using 7's but this also traps the 1 derive).
- We want to derive box 1 for sure because it cascades into nice derivations later.
- Using ugly bifurcation, 2 in r2c1 is impossible because it forces a 2 in r1c6.
- Actually, a 2 in r3c4 perfectly derives box 1's 2 without bifurcation! It's pretty beautiful since you need to use the logic in box 1 to proceed and has minimal impact on step 1.
- Unfortunately, it does allow you to easily get a 2 as your first digit but which does not lead to anything useful.

Next steps:
- Box 1's path can't proceed to the right as it will break box 3's path. It must stay in its own box.
- Now box 2's path cannot start to the left or will break box 3 for the same reason. This resolves the rest of the 2's!
- Box 3's triple allows us to resolve the 5-7 pair.
- Box 4's 3 must go to the right forcing box 7's 3 to go up.
- Box 7's path cannot be restricted to its own box so the 4 must go up leading to the 5-6 pair in the column being completed. The 7-9 pair in box 4 can be resolved.
- Box 5 cannot be the right 4 because both directions after are 5 restricted. This resolves the 4-6 pair in row 1.
- Box 3's path must go left now because of digit restrictions completing box 2 and column 4.
- Box 9's path must stay in its own box and there's only one possibility.
- After sudoku we're left with a deadly 6-7 unresolvable pair :(

- 7 in r7c5 is a nice red herring.

Solve steps:
- 8 in box 3 cannot be part of some path because both the path using the 6 in the box or a 6 outside the box would not work.
- The Manhattan distance from any valid path 8 to any other valid 8 is even.
- The Manhattan distance from a 1 to an 8 in its path must be odd.
- Therefore, if a 1 has an even Manhattan distance to one 8, none of the 8's can be part of its path which forms a contradiction for a 1 existing there.
- This restricts the 1 positions to a checkered board pattern. Using sudoku, we can derive all the 1 positions.
- Each 1 must have at least one orthogonally adjacent 2.
- If the 2 in box 1 is r2c1, it cannot path up because of the 5. It cannot path down because there is no 8 to path to. Therefore, r1c2 is the 2.
- Using sudoku, we can derive all remaining 2's except in boxes 5, 6, and 8.
- The 2 in box 7 is used in a path so we know where the 3's are in the same box.
- This forces the path in box 4 to go right which then comes back around and resolves box 7's 3's.
- In box 9, the 2 must connect to a 3 and we cam disambiguate which one.
- Box 1's path must go to the left because of the 3's. The 7 cannot go down because of the lack of good 8's. 9 finishes the box.
- Box 7's remaining digits means the 4 in the path must escape the box and we can complete the rest of box 4.
- Box 9's 4 cannot path down or else a 7 contradiction will occur in box 8 and this completes the rest of the box.
- After continuing with regular sudoku, it becomes obvious how box 3 paths. The rest of the sudoku proceeds smoothly until box 5's path resolves the deadly pair.
