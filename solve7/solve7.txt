How hard can it be to set a standard puzzle?

Expectation subversion? https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5wqq2nz
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y58mdlwv what am I even doing...
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyktlwzb looks unresolvable https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2tcnodt is the best we can do...
- Actually https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5nwrwdx
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2rj6mj5 does something... Unfortunately no solutions!
- Well rest in pepperoni the entire opening doesn't consider if you go up...
- The answer to the original question: very!

Attempt 2:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6n2m3a2 nice simple logic but where to go from here... almost certainly horizontal, consider shifting
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yycwll58 not bad, nice deduction but we get so little that we are forced to work with row 9 now.
- The problem is we don't need the earlier deduction! https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3m7rnku We could start with this but I like the ease of the previous one.
- One advantage of this is the pointing 1 sets up the next deduction.
- Here is a working 2 step deduction with no clue how to proceed further... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4u9axwf
- It's also not straight up linear with the 1 elimination.
- Another alternative is to branch both openings into one.
- The only thing we learn with them in conjunction is box 7 row 1 contains a 1/9.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2uv8a6d I think this works... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3ozmr6x
- Nope, logic is f'd again

Attempt 3:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5vtnnf6 keeping it simple because I give up and linearity or something but 28 is too powerful...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5blextk I'm literally going backwards, the 9/1 is too powerful
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y59gbrez please tell me this works!
- Ideas: 3 quadruple so not both 1 and 9.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y43porzv you could probably keep going by using a non-zero sandwich on column 8...
- Probably should move it to the top so the middle rows are required to derive first.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5k8dkbn it doesn't feel linear due to the weak association with the previous step.
- However, switcing the order breaks it.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y28axjr2 to force low digits, seems unactionable in the columns unless there is some magic in column 3.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6r236l3 unfortunately, this doesn't need the previous column 3 deduction but maybe that's ok since you need box 6.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y43456c2 just more piles and piles of idk, strangely enough we don't even need the 59 https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y654wxg5
- If we eliminate 35, we get the direction of sandwich 8 in column 2 and it's not too too bad but for all that effort, we only eliminate one cell...
- There is an alternative trick using a 6 quadruple in the bottom right of box 6 but it's too late now unless I restart...
- The pros is it fits the theme but there is no way to communicate that the step is needed so you can have frustration until you think to use the clue.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y59mdyyh so much info from the 0

727 tribute puzzle:
Ideas:
- 27's along a diagonal as the solution code -> impossible
- Just try to use as many 27/7 sandwich clues and use quadruples as necessary with 2/7
- Setting is probably best done by either placing clues gradually and constantly checking that a valid solution exists or intelligently brute forcing somehow...
- Maxing out 7/27's is not necessarily the best, we just need it to resolve and hopefully be somewhat pleasant
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3a7ph42 the symmetry might be extremely boring https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y549tmn8
- One restriction we could put is the sandwich clues need to read as 727 in that order...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2qjj7fc the problem is 6/8's cannot be disambiguated!
- The bigger problem is it's just super boring as you apply the exact same logic over and over

Quite a Mouthful progress:
