Rules:
- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- The 12 rods in the grid can be divided into 3 groups of 4. The 4 rods within a group are all identical after rotation. Different groups are allowed to have digits in common.

Diagonals:
- Lines are probably easiest?
- If we make them two groups of 4 each, we should be able to disambiguate everything with just one row.
- At the same time, intersecting lines sound hilarious.
- Maybe you could find some clever way to prove a diagonal must contain a duplicate.

- Maybe if you just shove enough diagonals, some interesting coloring behavior will emerge. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4ma99dl
- Best off using diagonals to avoid multiple forced naked singles. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4kdcfm2 -> https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxd9zoss
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5vsq9to omg this is the best we're going to get!
- The row we give shouldn't really matter I think as long as we disambiguate the deadly pattern https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yya9j683

How in the world can we possible solve this?
- We can first group them and count https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y36dhsot
- Just giving a 7 in r1c2 leads to https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyfq8rwb pretty nicely using the diagonal edges.
- One way we could resolve this is filling column 5 in box 2 but this feels like bifurcation. Actually, the much easier observation is the 3 which hits both edges.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6bn76gj here's the minimal so far, the orientation of green is using bifurcation.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5g83ath the 6 logic is insane!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yy46zxyq one more 4 gives the 7 orientations.
- To fix the green/blue orientations, I would love to show a duplication of 1's, in fact we can already do so in box 2!!!
- Maybe at this point, we can prove the rest of the digits are unique and just proceed with sudoku...
- Actually, you could have got the 1 duplication logic 20 years earlier if you provide a 7 in r3c4 but it feels sort of cheap whereas currently, there's many angles of attack.
- 9 sees everything. 7 is done. 8 sees everything. 1 is done. 3 sees everything. 2 as well. 6 is done. 5 sees the rest of green. We're done by symmetry.
- The easiest way to see this is just to notice row 3 where all the remaining unknowns are present.
- Sudoku proceeds to unresolvable patterns https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y655zf43
- The digits we give shouldn't help with the 6/7 sudoku at the start of the puzzle.
- Done https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6g9corq puzzle -> https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y57kobot

Lemmas:
- Rwo identical diagonal lines cannot intersect at opposite directions! It's pretty obvious though with concrete, short lines.
- 5 repeated diagonals cannot have a duplicate digit in the diagonal.
