Max Disjoint Sandwich

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhqzo4hz 1/2 outie followed by 2/3 outie, have to immediately disambiguate
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhdcuped very quick disambiguation it seems, 3 sandwich clues only at this point
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj88flyk 9 possibilities
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye77pzg5 weird 5/9 as part of the triple
- The best we can hope for after such a break in is 2 more sandwich clues and one short thermo
- Doesn't beat the baseline of the thermo portals -> dead in the water

6x6 arrow/sandwich
- Horizontal 3 into same box means >= 6 -> sandwich spread on two rows
- Horizontal 2 into the same box means there must be at least one of 1/6 in the far box

Misc:
