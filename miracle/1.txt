- Irregular miracle with 6x6, 7, 8 are impossible it seems
- Irregular with 9 is possible?

Mirror flip:
- Seems like there are actually none...
- With the limited flip, we can get pretty far https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ybxzdbuy
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9hngl3r seems to just keep going...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydht8ct8 screws up in multiple ways :(
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ycp43kf5 minimal resolve
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yccemvoy I think this is as far as it goes without the white dot...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y878pbwp death at the white dot
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y8runofl death at white dot down
- Actually 1-2 is impossible https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ybzrpzsl
- Using bifurcation, https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ycsc3ajw needs to not be a 1.
- Nevermind, it's broken https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y7whzyer from the very start
- In conclusion, f this puzzle, it wasn't going to be good anyways

XV Miracle Sudoku
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjfcc3gv Not a bad opening if we can combo it but hilariously, shifted left has literally 0 solutions!!!!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg8huwy4 we have consistent L's
- What about just X, no V, all givens, non-consecutive for the magical unique solution?
- In order to color the X's at all, you need to rely on knight's move unfortunately
- Also, consider using diagonals, both form an X anyways
- Also, you lose the slick opening... actually https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfvq2y2v is pretty good..
- One way to at least get an idea of viability would be to compute a board with no V's, non-consecutive, and knight's move
- Then, manually check if the colored version could be disambiguated

Approach 1: Brute Force
- 

Approach 2: Human Touch
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfvq2y2v slick opening tbh
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz3wqxtw actually ridiculously powerful...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhlq7ndy so much for disambiguation problems, good luck being a coloring puzzle, knight's move at this point would be tragic
- We would love to color based on 1/9 2/8
- Rest in pieces coloring https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygd7qhq3
- Really want https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yepu5aqu to be 3/7 so we can color more
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye34cjbd dead dead and dead
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg6yjxdl logic is quite nice but wrong coloring... to be honest though I'm in love with the opening
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfaj46nv wow we actually get coloring now
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yh9eh8pz broken, we have to link something...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yerxfqbf nope broken
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjbl7a26 Don't know what I was smoking but once again it unambiguously disambiguates...
- One possibility is to do all V's given in box x as a final disambiguation step!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yggnfxeo not too bad with the logic in box 2 but again the coloring...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yeqvmhge broken
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhmsu6s9 beautiful!!!!!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzhvw262 crazy logic to eliminate a 4/6... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg247b4x broken nvm
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjtb2fkc lol so simple but probably very exciting if you use colors LUL
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzv7w6nn broken again
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhp9jebd lol so close... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yegtg6j8 nope
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygq5rzrl breaks in box 9 are you kidding me...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhweghmm never ending breakages
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye2vr6gc I think I've tried everything at this point...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yk4e7roc surprising contradiction because of the matrix logic
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yh7gobyx I think we should let brute force take it at this point... leave the two x's if possible and roll
- Actually no valid nonconsecutive WTF!

- Evaluating, box 1 break in is beautiful, column 3 x is a bit too powerful but only if you use coloring
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz85orwq is fine, forces the green blue coloring
- Anything with 3 in r4c1 immediately breaks non-consecutive, the alternative breaks as well LUL
- Therefore we go back to beautiful checkpoint and not have global non-consecutive
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yffudcbc matrix logic is nice but sort of convoluted
- 173524689495861732628397145364719258817253964259486371931648527586172493742935816 seems quite easy to do first 6 columns
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzmc9hvv sort of ridiculous the number of X's... can even get a 5 yuck
- Slices through like code butter but on the other hand, it shouldn't ruin the starting logic at all
- I'm honestly not a fan and it dilutes the opening because a user might try anyways
- What if we use a different ruleset, all X's given, no non-consecutive but use knight's move strictly within those 3 columns which wouldn't be actionable at the start
- I remain unconvinced of the 6 column non-consecutive unless there are very very few X's in the middle columns.

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz3kcr2q lol wtf, there's no way this is human solvable...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yg7pttek 9 X's pain beyond belief...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydlu66q6 11 X's not bad good luck getting this with coloring LUL
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjoeqvo2 at this point, we should just minimize X's and think about 1/4 6/9 placements.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjdd6k6v no X's connecting to column 6
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygwrvt32 Beware of deadly patterns
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzflgufp seems pretty promising... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yf94u792
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfszgqkh column 9 done, in fact, two V's!!!!!
- Probably want to rotate and flip so you can say first x rows
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfjkakox done rotate

Testing:
1. Input into X count checker
2. Try solving with opposite parity
3. Try solving without coloring
4. Sanity check all logic

Other possibilities:
- Start with https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzspct4o
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yesk4hwp maybe some genius way to solve but beyond me
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yh8mwcwh solvable via box 8 but extremely tricky and non-obvious
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj4bnlux wait, that was actually great to use the clone...
- The clone is known from puzzle start but is not actionable until it hard eliminates the cells above it!
- You can get 5 to two positions in box 5 from start but it doesn't help
- You can also get more clones but it doesn't seem too helpful, still beautiful though
- Actually that translates into 4/6 in box 5 oh wow
