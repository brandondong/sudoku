Ideas:
- Sandwich sudoku
- Odd even sudoku but only provide odds, but you might as well just provide odd digits
- Just regular sudoku but be clever about given digits???

Sandwich sudoku:
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5s73mmy
- Row 1 can either have an outside 8 or 2-6 separated as 3-5 would force too many evens in the center.
- Row 2 with a value of 8 cannot be 2-6 or 3-5. Same with row 3 but it doesn't really tell you where the 1-8-9 triples are.
- Row 6 reveals almost the entire parity structure of the board.
- Row 5 as well and it's forced when supplying a 3.
- It combos quite well with column 5 if you replace 8's with 2's as you wouldn't be able to disambiguate between a 2-4 or 6 until you complete row 5. 2-6 vs 8 also works.
- Row 2's sum then disambiguates the 2-4 pair. Giving row 8 also works.
- Giving row 9's sum might actually be cooler and shouldn't give away anything prior with the 29 column sum. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyt4p5wo
- The sum in column 3 gives away the structure of the column and combos into row 9!! https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yypha5eg
- Row 1's sum shouldn't be able to combo off with column 2's sum to start the puzzle. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyttuket
- Either of box 1's 2 placements should work so we need row 7's sum to disambiguate. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6ehsgqd
- At this point, we just need to disambiguate numeric pairs in a way that does nothing for parity.
- Possible obvious candidates include: diagonal and thermos but diagonals don't play well with sandwich sums.
- If you have a 5 cell thermos, you can disambiguate all the odds. Technically, it can be 4 if you know one end cannot contain a 1-9.
- 1-3-5-7-9 thermos in the top right corner doesn't reveal all the odds. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6a5xp28
- However, if we now add a thermos in the bottom left corner, we force a 6-7! https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxezlqre
- A 5-6 thermos in box 8 is most efficient. And we can finish it off in the center. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2v8haf5

Taking a step back:
- The opening trick with 1-3-9 in the center is too beautiful. It locks the 3 and 1-9 pair from being transferred.
- That alone is enough to resolve odd/evens except for corners in corner boxes.
- Column 2's trick with parity is too nice to pass up but doesn't necessarily need to force a 6-7-8.
- We do however want a 2 digit sum to be plausible on the outside and even 2 more would push it past to 16.
- Row 1's sum works super well with the previous clue and locks either a 2 or 4 outside the sandwich.
- Getting the bottom right corner as odd would resolve all the odd/evens but it doesn't look possible using one sandwich clue.
- Instead, sandwich clues on rows 7 and 9 combo nicely, with the even sum on row 9 not using the even digit used in row 1.
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y35c4jwd seems to be the minimal example, hopefully some thermo resolves all odds that uses r3c7 or r9c9.
- Sudoku thinks it resolves to https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyolc2j9 for some reason but this does lead to a valid solution...
- You can get to the same point using a 3-5-7 thermos in box 3 https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y26b266n

Provide odd digits:
- You can't only provide odd digits or else all evens are interchangeable.
- Can't only provide black dots as that only covers 1-2 and 3-6. But combined with white dots with 9, you wouldn't have to provide many.
- They also tell you there is an even-odd sequence.
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxwkso88 surprisingly leads to almost all odd/evens placed! https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6fjb5n9
- I don't really feel like giving away odd digits anymore since it could possibly reveal this structure in another way.
- You must reveal two more corner parities to finish off the puzzle.
- It would be hilarious to reveal r3c7 and r7c3 using diagonals with the evens.
- We can also reveal the 1-5 in box 9 using a 6 diagonal which reveals the 1 in box 3 playing beautifully with the previous 31 diagonal which can't contain 1!
- The 33 diagonal has minimum 5 in the odd cell while the 31 has minimum 3. Both diagonals are allowed to contain 2.
https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y57vzlv7 leads to https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yy7ha2f4 and the even odd neighbor ruleset is done.
- A 16 diagonal on the 9 with at least 3 on r9c4 forces a 1-3-3 with a 1-3 pair in box 7 and a 7 in r8c1. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y46k258b
- With just two more diagonals, you can derive all odds except for a 5-7 deadly pair. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2pvdrpt
- A diagonal must be used to resolve them and unfortunately cannot involve any evens.

Thermos:
- Thermos seems only powerful if you know the sequence is all even or all odd and I think it's going to be very noticeable if they curve.
