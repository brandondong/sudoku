If we give all green parity digits in every box, then we can eliminate half of all the 1 positions!
- 8 is really clean compared to 4 and it doesn't tell you anything about 9!

- We can derive all the 1 positions from here!

For the 2's:

- We know there must be a 2 in r7c3 or r8c3 from box 1 and 4.
- No contradiction if we make r8c9 a 2 and when we do, all 2's are different from the solution except r4c5.
- If we force r4c5 to not be a 2, there's no contradiction either.
- By giving the fake 2 in r5c9, we can derive 6 2's. Only the last 2 is interesting.
- We'd have to place a lot of 3's to make it interesting.
- We could potentially trap a path into a corner and show that all other possibilities lead to path contradictions (e.g. box 1 using 7's but this also traps the 1 derive).
- We want to derive box 1 for sure because it cascades into nice derivations later.
- Using ugly bifurcation, 2 in r2c1 is impossible because it forces a 2 in r1c6.
- Actually, a 2 in r3c4 perfectly derives box 1's 2 without bifurcation! It's pretty beautiful since you need to use the logic in box 1 to proceed and doesn't mess up step 1.

Next steps:
- Box 1's path can't proceed to the right as it will break box 3's path. It must stay in its own box.
- Now box 2's path cannot start to the left or will break box 3 for the same reason. This resolves the rest of the 2's!
- Box 3's triple allows us to resolve the 5-7 pair.
- Box 4's 3 must go to the right forcing box 7's 3 to go up.
- Box 7's path cannot be restricted to its own box so the 4 must go up leading to the 5-6 pair in the column being completed. The 7-9 pair in box 4 can be resolved.
- Box 5 cannot be the right 4 because both directions after are 5 restricted. This resolves the 4-6 pair in row 1.
- Box 3's path must go left now because of digit restrictions completing box 2 and column 4.
- Box 9's path must stay in its own box and there's only one possibility.
- After sudoku we're left with a deadly 6-7 unresolvable pair :(

- 7 in r7c5 is a nice red herring.
