Parity Regions

https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=0004Z9

- Another option is to do consecutive regions.
- Whatever the case, it would be nice if every cell was in some region.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y8ak8bud it's actually probably really difficult...
- If we were to brute force search for one, we should first just see if parity is possible.
- This requires no odd region size > 9 or even region > 8. Even regions must be even sized and vice versa.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9ft8pug seems unlikely that this is possible unless you have many many diagonal separations.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yaz6xzd3 without odd parity restriction... With the parity restriction seems impossible.
- Push comes to shove, we could just do +1/-1 but that feels awful...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9tr38z6 we can get one big odd region + valid even regions but this puzzle is probably dumb...
- Even continuous region just seems impossible.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yameyr3n inversion count 3.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ycwz8a2z inversion 2...
- Maybe with an identical ruleset it would be okay. Lower inversion cell number may be better.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yag7syy5 2 inversion cells but there are conflicting 2's in a region + 1 odd cell.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ybs9crhs 8 inversion

Logic:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y9bbaw7k with negative constraint.
- There is literally no logic except for neighboring digits, what a colossal failure.

Thermo/Palindrome/Odd Mix-up

The problem with creating a puzzle using thermometer, palindrome, and odd cell constraints is that a palindrome with a single odd cell constraint looks very similar to a thermometer.
Fortunately, I remembered to write down which was which while creating the puzzle.
Unfortunately, it turns out dogs don't just eat homework! What a disaster!

Rules:
- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- For each connected line and circle, either:
1) They represent a thermometer (numbers on a thermometer must strictly increase as they move away from the bulb)
2) The circle must contain an odd digit and the line (which extends into the circle) is a palindrome (if a number appears as the xth cell from one end of a palindrome, it must also appear as the xth cell from the other end).

Distinguishing logic:
- It would be great if we had a lot of long lines.
- We could also do odd circle + palindrome vs thermo lol
- 1. No possibility of 1/9.
- 2. Bad quadruple https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yct5fbee!
- 3. Naked single for palindrome.
- Half combos into a forced palindrome: https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5kekplr
- It's a bit too obvious though once you fill in the possibilities.
- Convoluted as hell reasoning to eliminate a palindrome. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4or97p4
- A length 6 palindrome with the appropriate end in either box would be enough to force the palindrome.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3yanef2 is arguably a bit nicer.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y553gne2 one valid possibility but no flow at all.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2xd33wf so close :(
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y55z4w4x dead again
- If you play it safe like this, you get nothing
- Somewhat working! https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3daooqw forced due to position of 2!
- I would love to make a naked single with the virtual 6-9 pair but they're too far away.
- We can create an undecided thermo/palindrome https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxvd98kj
- If we can force a 2 in column 1 of box 7, we can work on the virtual 6-9 pair.
- Alternatively, we could force a 3 to target r3c1 odd.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2vzhz86 is somewhat okay as it needs the 8 and creates a 7-9 pair to combo into a thermo hopefully.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y57yb426 maybe? We got the naked single odd done. Still a valid board https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxtmp4z2
- The virtual 6-9 pair dream is dead at this point but we did get the majestic odd naked single. And the puzzle keeps going sigh.
- There is a 7-9 virtual pair here but using it is impossible https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5n8znov
- My god this puzzle just does not want to give up https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2aje3kw, we're really running out of real estate...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5fbhazo alternative placement, would be hilarious to make the 3-4-3 connected and ambiguous.
- Alt 3: https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyloeo5b a bit nicer logic to eliminate the thermo using the 6-9.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yywc7y2d shouldn't be actionable before the right is done.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5pkd7eg so close please. Basically out of real estate at this point.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yycxw7uz it just never ends. I don't think the 1-3-9 is super actionable. It falls into the freebies after the odd naked single.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxjyhnau not a terrible way to end it.

Review:
- I'm not a big fan of the 1-3-9 at all. Feels awful. The 3-3 is super cool at how useless it appears.
- I definitely want to require that deduction first.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y26bxgp8 much better!

Anything we can remove?
- 3-3 is definitely needed.
- Diagonal thermo does a lot of work.
- We could probably make the ending sudoku much more difficult and force the 2-3 observation but that's just mean...

Look:
- #D0D0D0
- Line width 0.6
- Circle width < 0.8 but I prefer the look of .75
- Unfortunately, the lines look really ugly over the cells.
- We can disable conflict highlighting in the link itself: https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y66r44d8

Potential images:
- Broken pencil to theme around the broken creation of the puzzle.
- Can't have any branching thermos.
- The completed board sort of looks like Jar Jar thinking from a distance...
