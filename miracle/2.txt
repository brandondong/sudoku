Then we gonna roll...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhxpsj5e Not vomit inducing beginning but it's really not clear how you could continue with only 10 clues
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye4tr92n very bifurcatee and you even require forcing this to happen in column 1
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjn7hhbe so unrestricted it feels like

Possible X clues:
- X-sum with 10:
- 2-8, 3 1/6 2/5, 4 1/2/3

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yznalabf wow really not bad, columns 7-9 is really surprising and we need to work off of that!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfrm8dpu wow it really keeps going please don't break...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj3m92e7 omg please please please so nice that we need the rhs before proceeding to the lhs
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygomsxyh lol nope insta death
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydlx4rcv even more insta death
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhfohd7f seems like this is actually quite restricted, both outer is death and bother inner leads to both outer
- Not obvious at all, you could make a 5* puzzle this way lul
- Fun fact, they are also aligned... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhadmjha
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz8gzzn7 wow broken via the 4/6!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfo7c846 good to know that the entire premise is broken LUL

Inner Sandwich Sudoku, take two

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfep9can beautiful break-in, would be a shame if this did not get permanently released as a puzzle
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfkr7qa3 pretty cool, difficult to see maybe a bit tedious
- Unfortunately, https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjdxqfu5 is great but breaks in a multitude of ways

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye3ty9z2 seems very unactionable
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjh8yflr very nice derivation of the 1 position in row 8 only using a 2-cell thermo!
- Death but maybe on the right track https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yenb6cwa
- We have essentially proven that with a single dash, 1 is forced into r8c8 but it's impossible to see without bifurcation
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfxzyu57 absolutely bonkers in difficulty

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygg3we5m seems to be quite rewarding going down this path
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfz56da9 it turns out 1/9 pair in box 1 will eventually break
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzhaqdcc more derivations following this path, just trying to see if there even is a solution
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yghsn75c more bifurcation
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye7l84j3 okay I think we actually died for real rest in peace....

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfo49oxw path down 29
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzd77eju 5 + 6 = death, therefore 5 is just death https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yebxpttx

- Two solutions found oh boy
- No extra inner sandwiches which I guess is not too surprising...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj4fzxe6 clever thermo but doesn't buy us much
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydk9mgdf add stuff with impunity while giving us nothing, although linear
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygxrhf8p I'm getting absolutely zero give
