Then we gonna roll...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhxpsj5e Not vomit inducing beginning but it's really not clear how you could continue with only 10 clues
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye4tr92n very bifurcatee and you even require forcing this to happen in column 1
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjn7hhbe so unrestricted it feels like

Possible X clues:
- X-sum with 10:
- 2-8, 3 1/6 2/5, 4 1/2/3

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yznalabf wow really not bad, columns 7-9 is really surprising and we need to work off of that!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfrm8dpu wow it really keeps going please don't break...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj3m92e7 omg please please please so nice that we need the rhs before proceeding to the lhs
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygomsxyh lol nope insta death
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydlx4rcv even more insta death
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhfohd7f seems like this is actually quite restricted, both outer is death and bother inner leads to both outer
- Not obvious at all, you could make a 5* puzzle this way lul
- Fun fact, they are also aligned... https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhadmjha
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz8gzzn7 wow broken via the 4/6!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfo7c846 good to know that the entire premise is broken LUL
- 11 is probably fine with 2-4-5 or 2-3-6.

- 9 question mark?
- Same core logic applies, r5c1/r5c2 cannot have 0 1/9's nor 2 1/9's.
- Actually it's a lot simpler with 9's because of row 3.
- Nope, broken just like the 10's we have a bad quadruple https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yefjphsm

- 11/12/13
- All three numbers have the property that they are either one in the middle, one outside or both outside with minimum span
- Therefore you need two of the first and one of the second
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yf2u7qgc seems quite unrestricted unlike 9/10
- X-sum is only 2-9 or 3 1/7 2/6
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzhgj6fh opposite X-sum gets this pattern (https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhwnzd32)
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yggfny32 seems like it's holding up so far
- Could also do horizontal but that just gets you to 2/3 pair
- Hella promising https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygumrqyz please don't break!
- The 2/3 pair interaction into rhs 3 back into lhs is super nice
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhxoxja6 horrible disaster
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yze452yw hello darkness my old friend
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye5vrfsk o my bejesus this is so dumb
- We could try various shifts
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygcg9ysq death again, the outer cannot be the 2 but that's impossible to see without bifurcation
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjuwr3l8 death again
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yelpc48o okay so we can actually prove that there must be something in the middle because 35 is not divisible by 3 wow LUL
- Actually not necessarily in the middle
- If you can provide some smart way of disambiguating the outer pattern, we could work from there...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz3fe5ba not terrible
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye283gfz probably better
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj8cblw5 Nope broken actually ludicrous
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfw7dna8 Technically possible to derive this far but impossible in practice https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yznrllvv is reasonable
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygf6ygg6 seems like it is still alive but uggggg...
- To be fair, restricting to only outside clues is probably outright impossible
- At this point, we should just solution search and work backwards because anything and everything can cause breakage
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yer8mr28 holy this is hella fine!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhnannyb hello derivation...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye63tady through crazy bifurcation we get this...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yeylbcgy not a bad alternative plus you cannot sidestep the rhs addition logic
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye2dg86y not a bad setup relying on the 2 in the column but broken
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yew4y2cr two sandwich clues means we know a 2 in box 8...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye26n2ol not bad what else you got?
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygpb975j omg why...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfovomjl breaks again...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjmqere2 omg so close...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yhjkotuh ????? solvable for sure...

Who do ya got in mind?

12:
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yz22p53l not bad, 5/7 on leftmost
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzdk3arh 1 on outside breaks btw

Inner Sandwich Sudoku, take two

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfep9can beautiful break-in, would be a shame if this did not get permanently released as a puzzle
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfkr7qa3 pretty cool, difficult to see maybe a bit tedious
- Unfortunately, https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjdxqfu5 is great but breaks in a multitude of ways

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye3ty9z2 seems very unactionable
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yjh8yflr very nice derivation of the 1 position in row 8 only using a 2-cell thermo!
- Death but maybe on the right track https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yenb6cwa
- We have essentially proven that with a single dash, 1 is forced into r8c8 but it's impossible to see without bifurcation
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfxzyu57 absolutely bonkers in difficulty

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygg3we5m seems to be quite rewarding going down this path
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfz56da9 it turns out 1/9 pair in box 1 will eventually break
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzhaqdcc more derivations following this path, just trying to see if there even is a solution
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yghsn75c more bifurcation
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ye7l84j3 okay I think we actually died for real rest in peace....

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yfo49oxw path down 29
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yzd77eju 5 + 6 = death, therefore 5 is just death https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yebxpttx

- Two solutions found oh boy
- No extra inner sandwiches which I guess is not too surprising...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yj4fzxe6 clever thermo but doesn't buy us much
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ydk9mgdf add stuff with impunity while giving us nothing, although linear
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=ygxrhf8p I'm getting absolutely zero give
