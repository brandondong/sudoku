If we give all green parity digits in every box, then we can eliminate half of all the 1 positions!
- 8 is really clean compared to 4 and it doesn't tell you anything about 9!

- We can derive all the 1 positions from here!

For the 2's:

- We know there must be a 2 in r7c3 or r8c3 from box 1 and 4.
- No contradiction if we make r8c9 a 2 and when we do, all 2's are different from the solution except r4c5.
- If we force r4c5 to not be a 2, there's no contradiction either.
- By giving the fake 2 in r5c9, we can derive 6 2's. Only the last 2 is interesting.
- We'd have to place a lot of 3's to make it interesting.
- We could potentially trap a path into a corner and show that all other possibilities lead to path contradictions (e.g. box 1 using 7's but this also traps the 1 derive).
- We want to derive box 1 for sure because it cascades into nice derivations later.
- Using ugly bifurcation, 2 in r2c1 is impossible because it forces a 2 in r1c6.
- Actually, a 2 in r3c4 perfectly derives box 1's 2 without bifurcation! It's pretty beautiful since you need to use the logic in box 1 to proceed and doesn't mess up step 1.
