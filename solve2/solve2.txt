Ideas:
- Sandwich sudoku
- Odd even sudoku but only provide odds, but you might as well just provide odd digits
- Just regular sudoku but be clever about given digits???

Sandwich sudoku:

- Row 1 can either have an outside 8 or 2-6 separated as 3-5 would force too many evens in the center.
- Row 2 with a value of 8 cannot be 2-6 or 3-5. Same with row 3 but it doesn't really tell you where the 1-8-9 triples are.
- Row 6 reveals the entire parity structure of the row and therefore boxes 4, 5, and 6.

Provide odd digits:
- You can't only provide odd digits or else all evens are interchangeable.
- Can't only provide black dots as that only covers 1-2 and 3-6. But combined with white dots with 9, you wouldn't have to provide many.
- They also tell you there is an even-odd sequence.

- I don't really feel like giving away odd digits anymore since it could possibly reveal this structure in another way.
- You must reveal two more corner parities to finish off the puzzle.
- It would be hilarious to reveal r3c7 and r7c3 using diagonals with the evens.
- We can also reveal the 1-5 in box 9 using a 6 diagonal which reveals the 1 in box 3 playing beautifully with the previous 31 diagonal which can't contain 1!
- The 33 diagonal has minimum 5 in the odd cell while the 31 has minimum 3. Both diagonals are allowed to contain 2.
