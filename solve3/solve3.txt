Rules:
- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- The 12 rods in the grid can be divided into 3 groups of 4. The 4 rods within a group are all identical after rotation. Different groups are allowed to have digits in common.

Diagonals:
- Lines are probably easiest?
- If we make them two groups of 4 each, we should be able to disambiguate everything with just one row.
- At the same time, intersecting lines sound hilarious.
- Maybe you could find some clever way to prove a diagonal must contain a duplicate.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5ymk8yv
- Maybe if you just shove enough diagonals, some interesting coloring behavior will emerge. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4ma99dl
- Best off using diagonals to avoid multiple forced naked singles. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4kdcfm2 -> https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxd9zoss
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5vsq9to omg this is the best we're going to get!
- The row we give shouldn't really matter I think as long as we disambiguate the deadly pattern https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yya9j683

How in the world can we possible solve this?
- We can first group them and count https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y36dhsot
- Just giving a 7 in r1c2 leads to https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyfq8rwb pretty nicely using the diagonal edges.
- One way we could resolve this is filling column 5 in box 2 but this feels like bifurcation. Actually, the much easier observation is the 3 which hits both edges.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6bn76gj here's the minimal so far, the orientation of green is using bifurcation.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5g83ath the 6 logic is insane!
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yy46zxyq one more 4 gives the 7 orientations.
- To fix the green/blue orientations, I would love to show a duplication of 1's, in fact we can already do so in box 2!!!
- Maybe at this point, we can prove the rest of the digits are unique and just proceed with sudoku...
- Actually, you could have got the 1 duplication logic 20 years earlier if you provide a 7 in r3c4 but it feels sort of cheap whereas currently, there's many angles of attack.
- 9 sees everything. 7 is done. 8 sees everything. 1 is done. 3 sees everything. 2 as well. 6 is done. 5 sees the rest of green. We're done by symmetry.
- The easiest way to see this is just to notice row 3 where all the remaining unknowns are present.
- Sudoku proceeds to unresolvable patterns https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y655zf43
- The digits we give shouldn't help with the 6/7 sudoku at the start of the puzzle.
- Done https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6g9corq puzzle -> https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y57kobot

Solve steps:
- Begin by marking r7c2 as green and r7c3 as blue.
- Column 2 contains the all three groups. So does row 3 and box 6. Therefore, the two remaining are either green or red.
- The top cannot be green as a 7 cannot appear in green. The diagonal in box 1 must therefore be blue because a 7 cannot appear in it either. r5c3 is 7.
- The 7's in column 5 and 7 resolve which diagonal in the set is red.
- r4c8 cannot be 7 as that would force a 7 in r6c6. This makes the next step too easy, perhaps https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxpge4p4
- Both red edges see r4c5 and r4c6 so the other diagonal must be red. r4c5 is blue because of r8c5.
- A 7 in r4c8 forces r2c9 to be 7 and there becomes no place to put a 7 in box 9.
- r4c5 cannot be 6 as that would make r7c7 and r5c6 both cannot be green.
- 6 can only be in r5c6 in box 5 as r5c5 would eliminate all greens in the remaining set.
- 6 can be placed in box 2 and box 1. There is some dark magic to place the 6 in r6c1 which shouldn't lead to much except finishing the rest of the 6's.
- Actually the 7's can be placed now as well.
- In box 2, the green 1's must match the blue 1's. This resolves all diagonal orientations and that digit which must be 1.
- Row 3 shows all the remaining colors must be unique.
- Unfortunately, just giving the deadly pattern is not enough. I need to give away another digit but I think it's worth it to get the beginning logic plus the alternative path with the 6.
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyvadur8 -> puzzle https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6d2b2mw
- Okay, maybe it is possible without revealing the 7's at all https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6hnlhhj box 6 the 1 is restricted to a row, then the 1's duplicate in box 5!
- We still know they're all separate digits through their various interactions.
- Box 3 forms a 3-5 pair giving info to the 2's!
- Now box 9 differentiates the 3-5 pair in box 3! It's not pretty but it looks like the rest of the puzzle is solvable. https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yysc4c2t

Lemmas:
- Rwo identical diagonal lines cannot intersect at opposite directions! It's pretty obvious though with concrete, short lines.
- 5 repeated diagonals cannot have a duplicate digit in the diagonal.
