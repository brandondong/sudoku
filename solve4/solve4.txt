Tetris Sudoku

Ideas:
- Cover the board with tetris pieces except 1 cell.
- Each piece summing to 20 is awful for humans.
- Each piece having uniform parity is probably interesting but sounds extremely difficult to allocate parity if not impossible.
- There's 36 evens and 45 odds in the grid so definitely impossible.
- We could partially fill the grid but then we would need so many numbers which would ruin the aesthetic.
- Pieces and be colored and some pieces may be given showing a tetris game in progress.
- Maybe 4 consecutive digits which would interact nicely with sandwich sudoku.
