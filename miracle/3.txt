Thermo/Renban/Odd Mix-up

0xd0

Ideas:
- Both have set properties (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KokZykCkgUw length 6 thermo's where >= 3 are in one line are key)
- Renban with length >= 5 must contain a 5, length >= 6 must contain a 4/5/6 and so on
- Would be nice to use a 4/5/6 to fully eliminate a possibility in a thermo to force one or the either
- Once you've established a length 6 renban or a length 7 thermo, this should be possible...
- We probably want the break-in to use something with set theory somehow but I don't think it's enough by itself...
- Would be classic to have an odd cell full elimination again

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5s8ufy5 interesting pattern, you could put a 5 to instant disambiguate right now...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y57ve9ag using a 4 leads to nice logic on the red
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y44lj5y6 seems like we can't get shit...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6f4g856 if 5, you force this
- It means we can force 1/2 https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3emnqpb
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y6hfaeka much more graceful!

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2eqhykc gets me so little but what other choice do I have...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yyses9zq pretty nice combo, 6/7 prevents the renban
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxcxqetb nothing is helpful with this bottom right thermo
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yy2gkldj not bad but breaks the previous logic
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5eyoenb wow seems really cool
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y2b7cbb6 nice coloring lol but it leads to so little...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=yxbpgerv The 4/5 pair leads to a forced renban but again, ugggg
- Nah actually that could have already been eliminated due to 4 in the box, dumbass
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4yuowlc what am I doing....

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5nw8nr6 not sure if better...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y34tjnht maybe maybe maybe...

- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4jztkke probably best route if you want to stick with coloring path
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y3prhks4 life is pain...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5wnwwn9 maybe salvagable?
- Would be great to use the fact that 6 is gone from r3c4
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y5akhwv9 hello darkness my old friend
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y24zugh5 I'm so dead, please just resolve somehow...
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y4jrejva some unbelievable coloring here
- https://f-puzzles.com/?id=y494hsjb excuse me?????????
